# Stage 2 of the Chart Coding Competition

## Dates: April 7-15.
The last submission will be accepted via @jobs_bot at 11:59 PM CET, April 15.

## Prize budget
at least **$150,000** to be distributed among the winners.

## Who can participate
**Everybody**. However, those who went through Stage 1 will have significant competitive advantage. 

## Goal
Build 5 graphs based on the input data we provide. In addition to line charts developed in Stage 1, we are inviting developers to support 3 new chart types: line charts with 2 Y axes, bar charts and percentage stacked area charts.

Those who aim for the first prize will also have to support the zoom in / zoom out feature and pie charts.
Zooming in allows to expand each data point into another graph with a more detailed X-axis.
For example, each point on a 365-day daily graph can be zoomed into a 24-hour graph on a 168-hour timeline, as shown on one of the video demonstrations below.

## Here are the 5 graphs expected in the contest:
### [Chart 1](assets/stage_2/1)
### [Chart 2](assets/stage_2/2)
### [Chart 3](assets/stage_2/3)
### [Chart 4](assets/stage_2/4)
### [Chart 5](assets/stage_2/5)

Note that you are not expected to implement the zooming transitions exactly as shown in the video demonstrations.
They may be replaced with any slick and fast transition of your choice.

The Y-scale on line graphs should start with the lowest visible value (Screenshot 4).
A long tap on any data filter should uncheck all other filters. 

As in Stage 1, we will provide input data for all 5 graphs within the next 24 hours.
Weâ€™ll also be updating you on the testing process, which, as mentioned before, will be public.


# Good luck!
